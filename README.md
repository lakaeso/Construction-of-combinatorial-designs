## 2.1 Basic definitions

__Definition 1.__ Design is an ordered pair $(X, B)$ where $X$ is a set of elements called points and $B$ is a collection of nonempty subsets of $X$ called blocks.

__Definition 2.__ Let $v, k, \lambda$ be be positive integers such that $v > k \ge 2$. A $(v, k, \lambda)$-design is a design $(X, B)$ such that following properties are satisfied:
-   $|X| = v$,
-   each block contains exactly $k$ points,
-   every pair of distinct points is contained in exactly $\lambda$ blocks.

__Example 1.__ Fano plane

Fano plane is a $(7, 3, 1)$-design. According to __definition 2__ following is true:
-   |X| = 7
-   Each block contains exactly 3 points
-   Every pair of distinct points in contained in exactly 1 block

Set $X$ contains 7 points: X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Collection B contains following blocks: B = {123.....}

picture.


Fano plane belongs to a class of Steiner triple sistems. Their distinct feature is k=3 and lambda=1.

__Theorem 1.__ ... proof.

__Theorem 2.__ ... proof.

Using these two theorems, (v, k, lambda)-design can be written as (v, b, r, k, lambda)-design.
